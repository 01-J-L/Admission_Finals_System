            <p>Dear {{ applicant_name }},</p>
            <p>Congratulations! We are pleased to inform you that your application (ID: <strong>{{ application_id_formatted }}</strong>{% if program_choice %} for the program: <strong>{{ program_choice }}</strong>{% endif %}) has <strong>Passed</strong> this stage of the admission process at {{ sender_name }}.</p>
            
            {% if application_status == 'Passed' and exam_status == 'Passed' %}
            <p>Additionally, you have also successfully passed the admission exam.</p>
            {% elif application_status == 'Passed' and exam_status == 'Failed' %}
            <p>Please note: While your application has passed this stage, your admission exam result was recorded as 'Failed'. Please contact the admissions office for clarification on how this affects your overall admission status, as your application may still be considered based on other criteria or this 'Passed' status might refer to a pre-exam screening.</p>
            {% elif application_status == 'Passed' and (exam_status == 'Not Taken' or not exam_status) %}
            <p>Your application has passed an initial review. Information regarding the admission exam (if applicable) will follow, or this 'Passed' status might mean you proceed to the next evaluation step.</p>
            {% endif %}

            <p>Please await further communication regarding the next steps. This may include details about final admission decisions (if this 'Passed' status is for an intermediate stage), enrollment, or other requirements.</p>
            
            <p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our admissions office.</p>
            
            <p>Sincerely,<br>The Admissions Team<br>{{ sender_name }}</p>
